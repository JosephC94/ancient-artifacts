        The Knights Templar order flourished during the Middle Ages. The name of the first leader of the Knights Templar order was Hugh de Payens. The leaders of the Knights Templar were given the title of Grand Master. There were 23 Grand Masters from 1118 to
        1314. The last leader of the Knights Templar order was Jacques de Molay (pictured), (1292-1314) who was burnt at the stake in 1314.

        The sword was crafted specifically in his name and is one of the twenty-three Grand Masters' swords, of which only 4 are still
        in existence today. Jacques named the sword 'Order' as his goal was to reform the Order of The Knights Templar and adjust it to the situation in the Holy Land during the waning days of the Crusades.

            The sword has been renamed 'The Curse', since while burning on the pyre, Jacques swore on his sword, cursing King Philip IV of France, his descendants, Pope Clement V, and everyone else who supported his death. De Molay said that within a year and a day,
            Clement V and Philip IV would die. He also said Philip's bloodline would reign in France no more. It happened as De Molay wished for, and death came for Clement first. He lost a battle with a damaging disease on April 20, 1314. Shortly after
            the Pope, Philip died of a stroke while hunting.

            A tragic death was also the destiny for all of Philipâ€™s successors. Between 1314 and 1328 all three sons and grandsons of the French king died. Within fourteen years from the death of De Molay the House of Caped no longer existed after it had stood for
            300 years. The sword was discovered 700 years later (2014) during some tiling repairs in the Chapel of the Beaune commandery, where Jacques de Molay was ordained, beneath the tiles on the floor on the chapel.
