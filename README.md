# Ancient Artifacts

[Link to website via GitHUb](https://github.com/JosephC94/ancient-artifacts/)

A website used for browsing, bidding, buying and learning about different ancient artifacts. The website contains a welcome page, registration and login functionality, a page of products listed, detailed info about each product and events they have been involved in, and the option to purchase the product. The website's primary focus is for the user to buy a product. The user must register and account or sign in, in order to navigate to the products.

The website focuses largely on what is for sale, each items journey of events, previous ownership and importance. The goals of the website are to:

* Provide knowledge of each product's journey and significance to entice customer's to purchase
* Allow a user to purchase products
* Excellent use of UX to ensure customers go from visiting the website to leaving the website having purchased a product or products
* Provide enough info of each item to highlight its importance for customers to recognise its true value for purchase
* Allow users to search for a product
* Allow users the option to bid on a product
* Easy navigation
* Simple order process that conforms with modern day online order processes
 
## UX
 
 ## Target audience and customers:
 
 ### Ideal customers for this website
 
 * Collectors of rare and valuable items
 * Customers who have a profound interest in historical artifacts
 * Rich customers with a fondness for history
 * Customers of particular beliefs and religions
 * History students
 * Archeologists
 * Historians


### These customers are looking for:

* Items of such rarity, that only 1 in the world exists of each
* Knowledge of the imortance/significance of the products
* The option to purchase one, or more, of these artifacts
* A story being told of each item and where its journey has led it to today


### The customers are able to achieve the above as:

* The website is simple and focuses primarily on the products listed and their journey of events/description
* There are no adverts on the site promoting any other kind of material - it only focuses on the artifacts
* The site does not contain an overload of JavaScript which would slow it down
* There are few products on the site due to their rarity, making browsing much quicker than having hundreds of products
* The website is easy to navigate as there are only a few links
* Each product has their own descriptive content
* The descriptions of each product provide indepth knowledge about the product and its journey of events and ownership
* A function for adding a product to a cart and naviagting to a checkout menu

### User stories:

1 As a historian, I would like a site that provides the ability to purchase ancient artifacts for studying
2 As a history student, I would like to know more information about some historical artifacts to gain some knowledge and insight about them
3 As a collector of rare and valuable items, I would like a site that allows me the opportunity to purchase more rare items to add to my collection
4 As a competitive buyer, I would like a site that draws a lot of attention to potential bidders
5 As a person interested in unique historical artifacts, I would like a site that gives me the opportunity to purchase and find out more information about some of them
6 As someone interested in historical events and artifacts, I would like a website that tells of the journey that an item went through for my own fascination
7 As a user of the bidding site, I would like the opportunity to narrow my search to something that directly interests me so I am not searching through each and every product


### Mock Ups

## All mockups found [here](https://github.com/JosephC94/ancient-artifacts/tree/master/mockups)

## Features

Each page of the website contains a navbar with content that alters depending on which page the user is on. The home page contains links for the products page (Artifacts) and the Resgiter/Sign In/Out Model. On the products page, the navbar contents change to Home, View Cart, Resgiter/Sign In/Out modal. View cart changes to Back To Products on the View Cart page and the Checkout page's navbar is the same as the Home page navbar. All contents of the navbar remain in the same position with each page.

The font family, colour and page layout of each page is the same. This is so that the website is easily recognisable and much more user friendly to navigate. Each page also contains a Title so the user can easily recognise where they are.

* Home Page:

This page contains a a brief intro to the website in the middle of the page with a title. Beneath the descriptive text, the user is presented with a slideshow of each product, and the name of each product, through a carousel.

* Products page (Artifacts page)

This page is accessed when a user sign in or registers. It displays a list of all of the products on site with an image, price, 'Buy now and add to cart' option, a link for the user to place a bid on the product, and a brief description.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
